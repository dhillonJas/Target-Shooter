# Target-Shooter
**INFO** -    A simple game where you try to take down as many red targets
          as possible without missing not more than three shots and
          without shooting not more than blue targets.
          
**HITZONE** - The area from which you can take down the targets is shown 
          by the red lines when the game is paused. To shoot the
          targets one will have to click outside these lines. The 
          closer to the line, the lesser points you get. The closer 
          to the border, the more points you get.
          
**POINTS** -  The points are added for each red target hit and deducted 
          double for each blue target hit. The points are shown at 
          the top left screen when the game is paused or over. 
          
**CREDITS** - The pictures used in showing points on the screen.
